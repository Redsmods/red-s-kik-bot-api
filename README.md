# Dedicated Kik Api For Beginners.

Use this library to develop bots for Kik Messenger that are essentially automated humans.

It basically lets you do the same things as the offical Kik app by pretending to be a real Iphone or Android client, It communicates with Kik's servers over a modified version of the XMPP protocol.

This is the easiest Way to Learn.

# Installation / SetUp / Independencies
I have Provided a BAT / BATCH Script. just run the script to install the Python Packages Needed.

- pip install beautifulsoup4
- pip3 install ./kik-bot-api-unofficial

This API uses The Tomer API https://github.com/tomer8007/kik-bot-api-unofficial
